If you try to run the program, please use the following format:
$ python proj1.py N K E

For example, if you wanna test N = 1, K = 2 with effort of 500000, please just type in:
$python 1 2 500000
then the program will generate the panel automatically and jump the fitness value.

Now I am using the picture "mon_child.jpg" as the test case. If you wanna test other examples, please
edit the imHeight, mWidth and the img in the program directly.
